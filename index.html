        <h1>Bombus</h1>

<p>Bombus is a cloud-based, scalable index of individuals, specimens, tissues, and their derivatives, serving biodiversity informatics researchers. This project was conceived by developers working on <a href="http://vertnet.org/index.php">VertNet</a>, a cloud based strategy for aggregating biodiversity records, and <a href="http://biscicol.blogspot.com/">BiSciCol</a>, a linked open data approach for connecting biological collection objects and their derivatives.</p>

<p>Codebase will be posted on Github soon.  Our kick-off, officially begins with the August 14th VertNet/BiSciCol hackathon in Berkeley, California.</p>

<p>The genus Bombus contains the Bumblebees. Bumbling along, with a wobbly flight, these bees are nevertheless effective pollinators.  Likewise, Bombus, our project, links objects and their derivatives as the Bumblebee connects flowers and pollen.  Quoting from Charles Darwin on "Humble-Bees" (an earlier word for Bumblebees): </p>

<p><i>"From experiments which I have tried, I have found that the visits of bees, if not indispensable, are at least highly beneficial to the fertilisation of our clovers; but humble-bees alone visit the common red clover (Trifolium pratense), as other bees cannot reach the nectar. Hence I have very little doubt, that if the whole genus of humble-bees became extinct or very rare in England, the heartsease and red clover would become very rare, or wholly disappear."</i></p>
